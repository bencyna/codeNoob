  ## Description:
  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg "License Badge")
    Code Noob, is a online forum designed for novice coders as they begin their journey through web development.
  ## Installation:
    Nil
  ## Usage:
    The purpose of code noob is to help new developers to connect with their peers, uncover useful ideas and resources so that they can maximise their time working through the inevitable complexities and frustrations that arise in each challenge. We decided to build an application that we would have loved to have access to when we started our own journey in coding, and this forum provided US with incredibly useful experience in building, our first full-stack web application.
